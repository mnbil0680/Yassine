After I left Intellia Therapeutics, I became a Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://www.matterworks.ai" rel="external" target="_blank">Matterworks</a>, a seed-stage startup company that trains AI models to understand mass spectrometry data, with a focus on metabolomics.

At the time I joined, we were preparing for the public launch of our AI product. I quickly became the "everything guy" related to software and DevOps. In addition to contributing to front-end and back-end application features, I assumed primary responsibility for our cloud infrastructure and automated over 30 steps of the deployment and release process.

We <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matterworks-launches-pyxistm---first-ai-powered-turn-key-platform-for-identification-and-absolute-quantitation-from-mass-spectrometry-data-302160973.html" rel="external" target="_blank">launched</a>, onboarded several customers, and received positive feedback. I'm proud to have played a key role in helping Matterworks go to market.
